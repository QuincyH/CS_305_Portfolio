1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. 
Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client was Artemis Financial which delivers financial services and provides 
financial planning solutions to its clients.  What they were looking for from our team 
was a way to securely store private data and secure communications that could be accessed by the client when they needed it.

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? 
Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I think I successfully used Maven, found vulnerabilities, and understood which vulnerabilities were real and which were false positives.  
I was also successful at understanding and figuring out how to suppress the false positives to understand better where the weaknesses were.  
Secure coding is necessary because it diminishes the possibility of actors with hostile intentions being able to access vulnerabilities left by the developers easily.  
This type of security adds hardness to the organization's infrastructure and ultimately saves the organization money and protects their data

3. •	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenging aspect of the vulnerabliity assessment was attempting to create the checksum,
I still have not completed grasped the concept, but I think I am getting closer and will figure it out.
I thought I was helpful at creating keystore keys and finding vulnerabilities

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities 
and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

The approach I took to increasing security was first running a vulnerabililty check to see where there were weaknesses.
Then adding layers from there, such as certificates and keys, also checksum and other verification tools.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? 
After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

This is the area that I had the most issues when it came to refactoring the code and verifying it's functionality.
I used Maven framework to check vulnerabilities and deteremine which were false and which were actual vulnerabilities.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

What I learned that will be helpful in fuute assignments is how to check vulnerabilities and how to create certificates.
We were given several books to help us learn more about coding and seucurity, those will also come in handy.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience.
What might you show future employers from this assignment?

For examples I would share with the employer what I learned and prject one that I added to this assignment, that would be where I started.  
I would also share some examples of what I experienced and where I was weak and the things I have done to improve on my weaknesses., 
So, they know I am still learning and have not stagnated.
